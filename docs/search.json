The only rule about this dataset is that it can’t be from TidyTuesday. Beyond that, it should be something truly of interest to your team, and a dataset that allows for a deep exploration.\nMost importantly, be prepared to brainstorm a bunch of ideas and discard them until you settle on a topic that everyone in the team is happy with and feels like a good choice for showcasing what you’ve learned in the class and how you can use that to learn something new and implement for your project."

Depending on the focus of your project, the following might go in here.\n\nIf using particular dataset(s), a brief description of each dataset including the reason why you chose the particular dataset, its dataset, its dimensions and any other relevant metadata. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\nIf answering a particular research question, the question itself and the reason why you chose this question.\n\nA weekly “plan of attack” outlining your steps to complete your project and including the team member(s) assigned to that task.\nThe final organization of your project repository. This means describing the project organization in your proposal as well as implementing that organization in your repo. Create any folders needed and place a README.md in each folder explaining what goes in there.\n\n\n\nPeer review\n\nReviewer tasks\nEach team will review the proposals of two other teams twice during the project. The peer reviews will be completed on TODO and TODO. On those days teams will have access to the project repos of the two teams whose work they’re reviewing.\nThe peer review assignments are as follows:\nTODO\nTeams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the Issues tab, click on the green New issue button on the top right, and then click on the green Get started button for the issue template titled Peer review.\nThis will start a new issue with a peer review form that you can fill out. Make sure to update the introductory paragraph with your team name and the names of the team members participating in the review. Then, answer each of the questions in the spaces provided underneath them. You’re expected to be thorough in your review, but this doesn’t necessarily require lengthy responses.\nRemember, your goal is to help the team whose project you’re reviewing. The team will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I review their work. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that’s an additional incentive to do a good job.\n\n\nReviewee tasks\nOnce you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed. You can do these updates all in one commit or you can spread it across multiple commits.\nRegardless, in the last commit that addresses the peer review comments, you should use a keyword in your commit message that will close the peer review issues. These words are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved and they need to be followed by the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title). So, your commit message can say something like “Finished updates based on peer review, fixes #1”.\n\n\n\nWrite-up\nYour have a lot more freedom in how you structure your write-up for this project compared to Project 1. This also comes with responsibility. You should make sure you have a clear introduction and a clear conclusion. You should also have other interim section headings that help the reader. Your write-up should be somewhere between 1000 and 2000 words. There is no expectation that you get close to the upper limit, anywhere in that range is fine as long as you have clearly explained yourself. The limits are provided to help you, not to set stressful expectations.\n\n\nPresentation\nYour presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up. Each team will have 5 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time.\nYou should create your presentation in a reproducible way, e.g., using Quarto. However you don’t have to use a package that is designed specifically for slides. If you prefer to build a dashboard or a Shiny app or a website, that’s fine too. The only rule is that it’s built reproducibly in R.\nYour evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don’t care how many slides you use to do this.\n\n\nWebsite\nEach of your projects will have a website. You can use the same workflow as for your first project or create something different. For example, if your project is building a dashboard, you might consider making your write-up a tab on that dashboard. Or if it’s building a package, you might consider making your website using the pkgdown package. Feel free to google your way around it or ask on the discussion forum or in office hours!"

If you do calculations by hand instead of using R and then report the results from the calculations, you will not receive credit for those calculations. Any answers/results given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be considered. For example, if you’re reporting the number of observations in your dataset, don’t just write the number manually, use inline R code to calculate the number.\nAll code reported in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. Code which produces certain warnings and messages is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean. In such cases you can add warning: false and message: false in the relevant R chunks. Warnings that signal lifecycle changes (e.g., a function is deprecated and there’s a newer/better function out there) should generally be addressed by updating your code, not just by hiding the warning."

In “how” we will focus on the process of generating a data visualization from pre-processing the raw data, mapping attributes of the data to plot aesthetics, strategically determining how to define the visual encoding of the data for maximal accessibility, and finalizing the visualization to consider the importance of visual appeal.

    "text": "Deliverables\n\nProposal\nYour proposal should include:\n\nA brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\nThe reason why you chose this dataset.\nThe two questions you want to answer.\nA plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n\n\nPeer review\n\nReviewer tasks\nEach team will review the proposals of two other teams. The peer review will be completed by Tue, Apr 19.\nThe peer review assignments are as follows:\nTODO\nTeams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the Issues tab, click on the green New issue button on the top right, and then click on the green Get started button for the issue template titled Peer review.\nThis will start a new issue with a peer review form that you can fill out. Make sure to update the introductory paragraph with your team name and the names of the team members participating in the review. Then, answer each of the questions in the spaces provided underneath them. You’re expected to be thorough in your review, but this doesn’t necessarily require lengthy responses.\nRemember, your goal is to help the team whose project proposal you’re reviewing. The team will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I review their proposals. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that’s an additional incentive to do a good job.\n\n\nReviewee tasks\nOnce you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed. You can do these updates all in one commit or you can spread it across multiple commits.\nRegardless, in the last commit that addresses the peer review comments, you should use a keyword in your commit message that will close the peer review issues. These words are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved and they need to be followed by the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title). So, your commit message can say something like “Finished updates based on peer review, fixes #1”.\n\n\n\nWrite-up\nYour write-up should consist of three parts:\n\nIntroduction (1-2 paragraphs): Brief introduction to the dataset. You may repeat some of the information about the dataset provided in the introduction to the dataset on the TidyTuesday repository, paraphrasing on your own terms. Imagine that your project is a standalone document and the grader has no prior knowledge of the dataset.\nQuestion 1: The title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\nIntroduction (1-2 paragraphs): Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you’re interested in this question.\nApproach (1-2 paragraphs): Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\nAnalysis (2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed): In this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so. All plots must be made with ggplot2. Do not use base R or lattice plotting functions.\nDiscussion (1-3 paragraphs): In the Discussion section, interpret the results of your analysis. Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\n\nQuestion 2: Same structure outlined for Question 1, but for your new question. And the title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\nWe encourage you to be concise. A paragraph should typically not be longer than 5 sentences.\nYou are not required to perform any statistical tests in this project, but you may do so if you find it helpful to answer your question.\n\n\nPresentation\nYour presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up. Each team will have 5 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time. Your presentation will be created using Quarto, which allows you to write slides using the same reproducible document structure you’re used to.\nRoughly I recommend 1 slide for introduction, 2 slides for Question 1, ans 2 slides for Question 2. You can imagine spending roughly one minute on each slide. You should feel free to have more (or fewer) slides. Your evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer).\nWe don’t care how many slides you use to do this.\n\n\nWebsite\nEach of your projects will have a website that looks like this. You are not expected to change the styling of the website, but if you want to, you’ll need to edit the _quarto.yml file in your repo. Feel free to Google your way around it or ask on the discussion forum / office hours!"

This means putting all of the content in the Quarto files provided, knitting them to obtain the output, and committing and pushing all files to your repository by the indicated deadlines. Your Quarto files (.qmd) and the resulting markdown files (.md) will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (as in, don’t change the Quarto file without also updating the rendered document!).\nAll results presented must have corresponding code. If you do calculations by hand instead of using R and then report the results from the calculations, you will not receive credit for those calculations. Any answers/results given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be considered. For example, if you’re reporting the number of observations in your dataset, don’t just write the number manually, use inline R code to calculate the number.\nAll code reported in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. Code which produces certain warnings and messages is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean. In such cases you can add warning: false and message: false in the relevant R chunks. Warnings that signal lifecycle changes (e.g., a function is deprecated and there’s a newer/better function out there) should generally be addressed by updating your code, not just by hiding the warning."

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using RStudio Workbench?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific version of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer.\nThese are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in RStudio Workbench. Since we have provisioned that server, we know it will work for all the labs/homeworks/exams/etc. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.2.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

Prior experience with R and Git/GitHub is preferred.\n\n\n\nCourse description\nData scientists often present information to disseminate their findings. This course introduces theories and applications of communicating with data, with an emphasis on visualizations. To support this approach, we will focus on the what, why, and how of data visualization. “What” focuses on specific types of visualizations for a particular purpose, as well as tools for constructing these plots. In “how” we will focus on the process of generating a data visualization from pre-processing the raw data, mapping attributes of the data to plot aesthetics, strategically determining how to define the visual encoding of the data for maximal accessibility, and finalizing the visualization to consider the importance of visual appeal. In “why” we discuss the theory tying together the “how” and the “what”, and consider empirical evidence of best-practices in data communication.\n\n\nCourse learning objectives\nBy the end of the semester, you will…\n\nImplement principles of designing and creating effective data visualizations.\nEvaluate, critique, and improve upon one’s own and others’ data visualizations based on how good a job the visualization does for communicating a message clearly and correctly.\nPost-process and refine plots for effective communication.\nMaster using R and a variety of modern data visualization packages to reproducibly create data visualizations.\nWork reproducibly individually and collaboratively using Git and GitHub."

    "text": "Assessment\nAssessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. They are comprised of three components: attendance and participation, homework assignments, and projects.\n\nAttendance and participation is expected throughout the semester.\nHomework assignments (6), due every other week (roughly), completed individually and submitted via Gradescope. Each homework assignment is worth 10% of the course grade. Lowest homework assignment score is dropped.\nProjects (2), mid-semester and end of semester, completed in teams.\n\nProject 1: Teams will be given a dataset to visualize. Project 1 is worth 20% of the course grade.\nProject 2: Teams will pick a dataset of interest to them and/or build an R package that implements a new type of data visualization in R. Project 2 is worth 30% of the course grade.\n\nThe deliverables for each project will include a data visualization, a write up of the process and findings, and a presentation. For the second project, you will be encouraged to think beyond a traditional two-dimensional data visualization (e.g. interactive web apps/dashboards, data art, generative art, physical/tangible visualizations, ggplot2 extensions, etc.).\nEach project will have a peer review component to provide at least one round of feedback during the process of development. Teams will provide confidential peer feedback regarding their teammates upon completion of the project. The scores from the peer evaluations, along with individual contributions tracked by commits on GitHub, will be used to ensure that each student has contributed to the teamwork.\nAll team members must take part in the presentation. Presentations can be given in person in class."

Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment (or possibly more) and will be reported to the College of Engineering Academic Integrity Hearing Board.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the course staff can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nLate work\n\nHomework assignments: A slip day allows you to submit an assignment 24 hours after the deadline and still receive credit without a late penalty. You are provided with a total of 3 slip days for the entire semester. Slip days may be used on homework assignments. You can use up to 1 slip day for a given homework assignment. Note that the lowest homework assignment will be dropped at the end of the semester.\nTo use your slip days, just submit your assignment late. No need to email telling us you are submitting using your slip days. Check Canvas to see how many of your slip days you have used before submitting an assignment late.\nIf you run out of slip days or submit after the slip day deadline, you may submit your homework assignment for up to 70% credit.\nProjects: Late work is not accepted.\n\n\n\n\nRegrade requests\n\nHomework assignments: Regrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nProjects: Copy the template below into an email. Send that email to soltoffbc@cornell.edu.\nSubject: > INFO 3312/5312 (REQUEST) Regrade\nEmail Message Template: > NetID: TODO  > Team Name: TODO  > Assignment: TODO > > Directly state the mistake(s) in the grading of your assignment. Be specific and specify the total points that you believed should be returned for each mistake. (1-3 brief and concise bullets): > > TODO > > (optional) If necessary, briefly explain why your approach to this assignment is a good choice (1-3 brief and concise bullets): > > TODO\nTips:\n\nWhen writing, please be respectful, thoughtful, and professional.\nBe brief and concise. Bullet points are encouraged. Please do not write a lengthy explanation.\nForm and ground your argument based on ideas and principles presented in this course. This is the primary criteria we use to evaluate your regrade request.\nAssume that we made a mistake; avoid accusing us being unfair or punishing you."
