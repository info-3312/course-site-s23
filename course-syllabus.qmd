### Course description

This is an applied introductory course for learners who wish to harness growing digital and computational resources. The focus of the course is on using data to identify patterns, evaluate the strength and significance of relationships, and generate predictions using **data**. These techniques are implemented using a **reproducible workflow** through the use of programming languages and version control software. Major emphasis is placed on a pragmatic understanding of core principles of programming and packaged implementations of methods. Students will learn how to use data to make effective arguments, in a way that promotes the ethical usage of data.

### Course learning objectives

By the end of the semester, you will...

- Conduct exploratory data analysis through data wrangling and munging as well as visualizations and summary statistics.
- Identify patterns in data to make predictions or to identify associations between variables.
- Evaluate the strength of patterns using statistical and substantive significance.
- Implement data science workflows using common, reproducible methods and software tools.
- Use data ethically and responsibly.

## Activities & Assessment

The activities and assessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. They are designed to follow the **Prepare, Practice, Perform** format.

-   **Prepare**: Includes reading assignments and lectures to introduce new concepts and ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities during lecture.

-   **Practice**: Includes in-class application exercises where you will begin to apply the concepts and methods introduced in the prepare assignment. The activities will graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.

-   **Perform**: Includes labs, homework, exams, and the project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to analyze real-world data.

### Lectures (Prepare)

Part of the class time will be lectures that introduce new concepts or review topics from the preparation videos. Lectures will **not** repeat everything in the readings, they will instead highlight important and known to be complex concepts and will be supplemented with live coding activities. You are expected to attend every lecture.

### Application exercises (Practice)

A majority of the in-class lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises will give you an opportunity to apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Tuesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures are due Sunday by 11:59p ET.

Because these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of **at least 85%** of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.

### Labs (Perform)

In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team's Git repository on the course's GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member's relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.

Labs are due 11:59p ET on the indicated due date.

*The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.*

### Homework (Perform)

In homework, you will apply what you've learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks.
You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.

Homework assignments are due 11:59p ET on the indicated due date.

*The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.*

### Exams (Perform)

There will be three, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you've learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments.

More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.

### Project (Perform)

The purpose of the [project](project-description.html) is to apply what you've learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work during the final exam period.

More information about the project will be provided during the semester.

## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Category              | Percentage   |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Homework              | 30%          |
| Labs                  | 15%          |
| Project               | 20%          |
| Exams                 | 25%          |
| Application Exercises | 10%          |

The final letter grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:

| Letter Grade | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| A+           | \>= 98             |
| A            | 93 - 97.99         |
| A-           | 90 - 92.99         |
| B+           | 87 - 89.99         |
| B            | 83 - 86.99         |
| B-           | 80 - 82.99         |
| C+           | 77 - 79.99         |
| C            | 73 - 76.99         |
| C-           | 70 - 72.99         |
| D+           | 67 - 69.99         |
| D            | 63 - 66.99         |
| D-           | 60 - 62.99         |
| F            | \< 60              |

## Course policies

### Academic honesty

**TL;DR: Don't cheat!**

Please abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:

-   You may discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.
-   You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.
-   **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

Any violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the [Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity](https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/dean/academic-integrity/code-of-academic-integrity/) and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment (or possibly more) and will be reported to the College of Engineering Academic Integrity Hearing Board.

### Late work & extensions

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.

### Late work

-   A **slip day** allows you to submit an assignment 24 hours after the deadline and still receive credit without a late penalty. You are provided with a total of **6 slip days** for the entire semester. Slip days may be used on **homework and lab assignments**. You can use up to 2 slip days for a given homework or lab assignment.
    
    To use your slip days, just submit your assignment late. No need to email telling us you are submitting using your slip days. Check Canvas to see how many of your slip days you have used before submitting an assignment late.
    
    If you run out of slip days or submit after the slip day deadline, you may submit your homework or lab assignment for up to 70% credit.
-   There is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.
-   The late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.
-   The late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.

### Waiver for extenuating circumstances

If you need a bit of extra time, **please use your slip days**. Slip days are specifically intended for legitimate reasons for needing an extension like disability, religious observance, Title IX, student athletics, medical problems, and military service.

If using your slip days for accommodations is not working for you or if you have an SDS accommodation which includes deadline flexibility, you may request a deadline extension in-advance of the deadline. We will work with you to develop reasonable accommodations that align with your individual situation.

To request a deadline extension:

1. Commit and push the work you have completed up to this point on the assignment.
1. Email [info2950-prof\@cornell.edu](mailto:info2950-prof@cornell.edu). In your email clearly state
    a. The assignment
    a. What you have already completed on the assignment.
    a. What you have left to complete.
    a. Your proposed deadline extension (e.g. *Monday, February 8th at 11:59pm.*)

### Regrade requests

Regrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.
