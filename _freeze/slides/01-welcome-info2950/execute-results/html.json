You may **not** directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.\n\n-   Exams must be completed individually. You may **not** discuss any aspect of the exam with peers. If you have questions, post as private questions on the course forum, only the teaching team will see and answer.\n\n## Sharing / reusing code policy\n\n-   We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted\n\n-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).\n\n-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source\n\n## Academic integrity\n\n1.  A student shall in no way misrepresent his or her work.\n2.  A student shall in no way fraudulently or unfairly advance his or her academic position.\n3.  A student shall refuse to be a party to another student's failure to maintain academic integrity.\n4.  A student shall not in any other manner violate the principle of academic integrity.\n\n::: aside\nSource: [Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity](https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/dean/academic-integrity/code-of-academic-integrity/)\n:::\n\n## Most importantly!\n\nAsk if you're not sure if something violates a policy!\n\n## This week's tasks\n\n-   Log in to [Cornell's GitHub](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu) - you already have an account!\n-   Complete the Getting to know you survey if you haven't yet done so!\n-   Read the syllabus\n\n## Something personal\n",
