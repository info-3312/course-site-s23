# What is data science?

## What is data science? {.smaller}

-   Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.

    > \[A\]n interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application domains[^1]

-   We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

-   This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

## Activities: Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   **Prepare:** Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by completing the readings
-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours, team meetings
-   **Practice:** Practice applying statistical concepts and computing with application exercises during lecture, graded for completion
-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data

    ::: nonincremental
    -   Lab assignments x TODO (first individual, later team-based)
    -   Homework assignments x TODO (individual)
    -   Three take-home exams
    -   Team project presented in the last lab session

## Diversity + inclusion

::: incremental
- **I want you to feel like you belong in this class and are respected**

- If you feel that we have failed these goals, please either let us know or [report it](https://diversity.cornell.edu/our-commitments/bias-reporting-cornell), and we will address the issue
- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
:::

## Accessibility

I want this course to be accessible to students with all abilities. Please feel free to let me know if there are circumstances affecting your ability to participate in class.

# Course policies

## Late work, waivers, regrades policy

-   We have policies!
-   Read about them on the [course syllabus](/course-syllabus.html) and refer back to them when you need it

## Collaboration policy

-   Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.

-   Homeworks must be completed individually. You may **not** directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

-   Exams must be completed individually. You may **not** discuss any aspect of the exam with peers. If you have questions, post as private questions on the course forum, only the teaching team will see and answer.

## Sharing / reusing code policy

-   We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted

-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).

-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source

## Academic integrity

1.  A student shall in no way misrepresent his or her work.
2.  A student shall in no way fraudulently or unfairly advance his or her academic position.
3.  A student shall refuse to be a party to another student's failure to maintain academic integrity.
4.  A student shall not in any other manner violate the principle of academic integrity.

## Most importantly!

Ask if you're not sure if something violates a policy!
